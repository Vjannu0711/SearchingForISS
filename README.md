# GOD'S EYE | ISS Object Detection
## By: Vrishank Jannu

### Project Description:
We live in a world where data is abundant and often unstructured. 
The goal of this project is to build a reliable and containerized Flask application that queries and returns interesting information from a large dataset that contains position and velocity data of the world-renowned International Space Station at given times as well as specific points in time and space when the ISS can be seen over select cities.
This project aims to automate the process of sifting through large and often complex datasets which is a necessary skill to have in the modern era run by big data.
